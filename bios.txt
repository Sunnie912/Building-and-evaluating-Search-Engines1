if !vml endif Jon Pearce I received my B.A. (1972) and Ph.D. (1980) in mathematics from the University of California at Berkeley. My area of specialty was mathematical logic. From 1980 to 1982 I did post doctoral work at the University of Colorado in Boulder. After a brief period as visiting professor at Ohio State University. I came to the San Jose State Math Department in 1983. From 1986 to 1990 I divided my time between teaching mathematics and computer science at San Jose State and developing a programming language for a small start-up company called Silma . I spent 1991 as a Fulbright Lecturer in Computer Science at the University of Zimbabwe . I returned to University of Zimbabwe as external examiner in 1993, 1994, and 1995. In the summer of 1996 I was a visiting professor of Computer Engineering at Bosphorus University in Istanbul. From 1997 to 1998 I developed Computer-Telephony applications in Java for a small start-up company called Capri Systems. I also answered Java questions at inquiry.com and gave lectures on design patterns to local companies. I spent the fall of 2001 as a Fulbright Lecturer in Computer Science at Colombo and Peradeniya Universities in Sri Lanka . I returned to Sri Lanka as a Senior Fulbright Specialist in the winter of 2004, summer of 2005, and winter of 2006. I was a Senior Fulbright Specialist in summer of 2006 at the American University of Armenia. I returned to the American University in summer 2007. That summer also marked the start of my involvement with the Summer University Program , which has taken me and a group of students to Switzerland almost every summer since. From Fall 2010 to Spring 2014 I was the department chair. I live in Santa Cruz; I write and travel as much as possible. My interests include object-oriented modeling, multi-agent systems, functional programming, logic, cognitive science, complexity science, and philosophy.

 Prof Dude in Computer Science Department i work in distributed systems, cloud, big data, networking, storage, and operating systems. i often get asked about reading lists and blogs, so i started collecting some . i love working with grads/undergrads on projects in the area of operating systems and distributed systems. if you want to work with me, please watch https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc19/presentation/keynote a great talk by remzi arpaci-dusseau. it has great advice for doing research. you can find out more information about projects that we are working on at http://www.sjsu.edu/people/ben.reed/systems-group/ (i do not work with students during the summer. internships are too important. if you can't get an internship, try engaging with an open source project. both are more valuable to you than working with a professor during the summer.) i'm also looking for good undergraduate programmers to participate in our programming team ! i'll also be running a hands-on storage class this fall run as a CS 180H or CS 280. no exams, just code and doc. contact me if you are interested in taking it.

B.A. 1987 Miami University, Oxford, OH, Mathematics; Computer Systems minor. Licenses and Certificates car and motorcycle license from california Bio once upon a time a little boy who was born in arizona moved with his family to ohio. he was excited to see snow. after a couple of days waiting for the bus in the snow, his excitement turned to misery. to this day he doesn't like snow. while not suffering in the snow he dreamed of living in "silicon valley" and becoming a professor. he went to miami university in ohio, spent a brief 2 years in spain, and got his masters at depaul in chicago. fortunately, tuition reimbursement while working in IT at sears and motorola paid for his education at depaul. he loved the midwest and considered himself to be a midwesterner. he was accepted to UCSC to work on his PhD. he was excited to see the ocean and go to the beach. after arriving in santa cruz, his excitement turned to disappointment when his first trip to the beach consisted of freezing cold water, stinky seaweed, and a naked guy running around. he loved the program at UCSC and ended up getting a position at IBM almaden research center, after an awesome internship there, while he was still finishing up his PhD. after many years at IBM, he left for yahoo research. it was hard to leave yahoo until they shut down the research division, so it was time for the boy to move on. he saw the things facebook was doing to connect the world, and he wanted to be part of that mission, but ended up going to osmeta, a little startup with some really cool tech and people. as chance would have it, facebook acquired osmeta, and the boy was able to work on really cool stuff at a really cool company that he felt was making the world a better place. by now the boy had been in california so long and felt so at home here that he considered himself to be a californian. in 2018, the boy found out that SJSU had an opening in the CS department. he applied and is now part of the CS faculty, and all of his dreams have come true: a faculty position in silicon valley. the end if you want the more official/boring version, here is my CV . if you want the sales pitch, here is my research statement . 
Mark Stamp Fall 2021 : CS 271 Topics in Machine Learning I am currently working on the second edition of my machine learning book. It should be with the publisher by December of this year, at the latest. The 3rd edition of my information security textbook has been sent to the publisher. There is no firm date yet for its much anticipated release to the general public. I recently completed a textbook with the catchy title of Introduction to Machine Learning with Applications in Information Security . I'm told that it makes a wonderful gift for any occasion. What kinds of projects do my students do? I'm glad you asked. Most of my students do security-related projects and there are tons of good project topics in security. Masters student projects (titles and completed reports) can be found here . Undergraduate projects are given here . What kind of teacher am I? I've posted selected student comments from my teaching evaluations. Of course, you can also check out my reviews at My_Professor_Is_A_Jerk.com (or something like that). Personally, I never look at those kinds of sites, for fear of what I might find. Links to many of the papers that I've written are here . The Google Scholar summary of citations of my articles can be found here . Microsoft Academic provides similar (although, strangely, much less complete) information here , and the "Semantic Scholar" version is available here . I've put together this list of information security journals, with a brief comment on each. I was interviewed about my malware-related research by the editor of a hackers' online e-zine. This scintillating, tell-all interview can be found at https://vx-underground.org/archive/VxHeaven/lib/i0009.html . My overly-detailed cv can be found here . Yes, I do have a life (well, sort of...). A few recent photos can be found here . The best way to contact me is via email . If you are local, feel free to stop by during my office hours to chat.
